This is a very early github repo for my next project using React as a tool to create an audio program. I'm excited to build this.

I found a way to code JS with a IDE expansion called Elementary after extensive research I did online. I have a great idea in ways to incorporate this into something I can possibly monetize considering I'm on the verge of becoming homeless.

Wish me luck!
